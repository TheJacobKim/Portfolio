## IRISDataSet ##
* This is a work done from IEEE's 2018 python workshop. 
* Using Python's matplotlib and sklearn libraries, I visualised and separted Iris flower dataset. Iris flower dataset consiss of 50 samples from each of three speicses of iris. 
* By using K-NN classification and support vector classifiers/machine I can sepearte different flowers in the dataset.
